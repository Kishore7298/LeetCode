## Target Sum

You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.

Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
``` 
```
Constraints:

The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.
```
#### Subset sum Approach:
```c++
/*
    Subset sum approach:
    We create two sets S1 and S2 where s1 has all the positive sign and S2 has negative sign.
    S1 - S2 = diff // We need to acheive this diff
    S1 + S2 = total
    S1 - (total - S1) = diff
    2 * S1 - tatal = diff
    S1 = (diff + total)/2;
    Now, the problem has reduces to, the number of ways to get the sum as S1
*/
int findTargetSumWays(vector<int>& nums, int S) {
    int sum = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    if(sum < S || (S + sum) & 1 ) return 0; // If the sum is less than diff or S + Sum is odd then not possible
    int target = (S + sum)/2;
    vector<int> dp(target+1, 0);

    dp[0] = 1;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for(int j = target; j >= nums[i]; j--) {
            if(nums[i] <= j) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - nums[i]];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[target];
}
```
#### Hashing Approach:
```c++
/*
    This approach is simulating the recursive approach of either choosing + num[i] or - num[i] for a number
*/
int findTargetSumWays(vector<int>& nums, int S) {
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    mp[0] = 1;
    for(int i =0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        auto copy = mp;
        mp.clear();
        for(auto itr: copy) {
            mp[itr.first + nums[i]] += itr.second;
            mp[itr.first - nums[i]] += itr.second;
        }
    }
    return mp[S];
}
```
