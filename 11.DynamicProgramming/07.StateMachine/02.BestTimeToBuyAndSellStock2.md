## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

#### Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
``` 
```
Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4
0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4
```

```c++
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int n = prices.size();
    vector<int>buy(n, 0);
    vector<int>sell(n, 0);

    buy[0] = -prices[0], sell[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        // todays's buy's state => stay in the bought state, or see if you sell it yesterday and buy 
        // stock today, if that yeild better buy state
        buy[i] = max(buy[i-1], sell[i-1]-prices[i]); 
        // Either choose to skip the sell or see the gain if you sell it for the current price
        sell[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1]+prices[i]);
        /*
            6 7 8 4
            Beginning: If you buy 6 you'll have a loan of 6 so it is -6, and if you sell it the same day the profit is zero. 
            Init: -6 0
            i: 1 => According to first statement, either I can retain -6 loan or sell it the previous day 
                    and buy the new stock today!
                    -> If i sell it yesterday, the gain will be zero and if i buy it today the loan amount will be-7
                    -> I choose to retain the last state because -6 loan is better than -7 loan!
        */
    }

    return sell[n-1];
}
