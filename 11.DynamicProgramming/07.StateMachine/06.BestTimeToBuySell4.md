## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Notice that you may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

#### Example 1:
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
``` 
```
Constraints:

0 <= k <= 109
0 <= prices.length <= 1000
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000
```
```c++
int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
    if(k == 0 || prices.size() == 0) return 0;
    vector<int> dp(2*k, 0);
    for(int i = 0; i < 2*k; i++) if(i%2 == 0) dp[i] = INT_MIN;
    // [buy, sell, buy, sell]
    for(int i =0; i< prices.size(); i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < 2*k; j++) {
            if(j == 0) {
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], -prices[i]);
            } else if (j % 2 == 0) {
                // buy state, when you buy you spend prices[j] and dp[j-1] is profit fro prev transaction
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-1] - prices[i]);
            } else {
                // sell state, you get money of prices[i].
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-1] + prices[i]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[2*k - 1];
}
