## Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

#### Example 1:
```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

```c++
string frequencySort(string s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> mp;
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
    for(int i =0; i<s.length(); i++) mp[s[i]]++;
    for(auto itr: mp) pq.push({itr.second, itr.first});
    string res = "";
    while(pq.empty() == false) {
        pair<int, char> elem = pq.top(); pq.pop();
        while(elem.first != 0) res += elem.second, elem.first--;
    } 
    return res;
}
```
