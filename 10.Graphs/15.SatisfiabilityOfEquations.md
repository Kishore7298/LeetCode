## Satisfiability of Equality Equations

Given an array equations of strings that represent relationships between variables, each string equations[i] has length 4 and takes one of two different forms: `"a==b" or "a!=b"`.  Here, a and b are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return true if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations.

 

#### Example 1:
```
Input: ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.  There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: ["a==b","b==c","a==c"]
Output: true
```
#### Example 4:
```
Input: ["a==b","b!=c","c==a"]
Output: false
```
#### Example 5:
```
Input: ["c==c","b==d","x!=z"]
Output: true
``` 
```
Note:

1 <= equations.length <= 500
equations[i].length == 4
equations[i][0] and equations[i][3] are lowercase letters
equations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'
equations[i][2] is '='
```
```c++

vector<int> ds(26);

class Solution {
    
    int find(int x) {
        if(ds[x] != x) {
            ds[x] = find(ds[x]);
        }
        return ds[x];
    }
    
    void uni(int x, int y) {
        int par_x = find(x), par_y = find(y);
        ds[par_x] = par_y;
    }
public:
    bool equationsPossible(vector<string>& equations) {
        for(int i =0; i<26; i++) ds[i] = i;
        for(string equation: equations) {
            if(equation[1] == '=') uni(equation[0]- 'a', equation[3]- 'a');
        }
        for(string equation: equations) {
            if(equation[1] == '!' && find(equation[0]- 'a') == find(equation[3]- 'a'))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
