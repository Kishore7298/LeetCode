## Possible Bipartition

Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size.

Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group. 

Formally, if dislikes[i] = [a, b], it means it is not allowed to put the people numbered a and b into the same group.

Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: group1 [1,4], group2 [2,3]
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: N = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
Output: false
``` 
```
Constraints:

1 <= N <= 2000
0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000
dislikes[i].length == 2
1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N
dislikes[i][0] < dislikes[i][1]
There does not exist i != j for which dislikes[i] == dislikes[j].

bool dfs(vector<vector<int>> &graph, vector<int> &states, int curr) {   // DFS traversal
    for(int v: graph[curr]) {
        if(states[v] == 0) {
            states[v] = -1 * states[curr];  // Marking the opposite state for all the adjacent people
            if(dfs(graph, states, v) == false) return false;
        } else {
            if(states[v] == states[curr]){  // Adjacent is already marked and is marked same as the current.
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

bool possibleBipartition(int N, vector<vector<int>>& dislikes) {
    vector<int> states(N+1, 0); // It can have three states 0 -> unvisited, 1 , -1 -> coloring 
    vector<vector<int>> graph(N+1);
    for(auto &elem: dislikes){  //Constructing the graph.
        graph[elem[0]].push_back(elem[1]);
        graph[elem[1]].push_back(elem[0]);   
    }
    
    for(int i = 1; i<=N; i++)
        if(states[i] == 0) {
            states[i] = 1;  // Initially, marking the state as 1 for all the disjoint points
            if(dfs(graph, states, i) == false)
                return false;
        }
    return true;
}
