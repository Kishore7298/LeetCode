##  Evaluate Division

You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` and values[i] represent the equation `Ai / Bi = values[i]`. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` represents the jth query where you must find the answer for `Cj / Dj = ?`.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

 

#### Example 1:
```
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
``` 
```
