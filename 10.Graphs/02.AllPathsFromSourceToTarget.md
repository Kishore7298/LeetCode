## All Paths From Source to Target

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node `graph[i][j]`).

 

#### Example 1:
![graph](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_1.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```
#### Example 2:
![graph](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_2.jpg)
```
Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: graph = [[1],[]]
Output: [[0,1]]
```
#### Example 4:
```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,2,3],[0,3]]
```
#### Example 5:
```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,3]]
``` 
```
Constraints:

n == graph.length
2 <= n <= 15
0 <= graph[i][j] < n
graph[i][j] != i (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
```

```c++
void dfs(vector<vector<int>> &graph, int currNode, vector<vector<int>>&res, vector<int> &path) {
    path.push_back(currNode);
    if(currNode == graph.size() - 1)
        res.push_back(path);
    else for(int i: graph[currNode])
        dfs(graph, i, res, path);

    path.pop_back();
}

vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
    int n = graph.size();
    vector<vector<int>> res;
    vector<int> path;
    dfs(graph, 0, res, path);
    return res;
}
```
