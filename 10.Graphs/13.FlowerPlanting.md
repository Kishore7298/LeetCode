## Flower Planting With No Adjacent

You have n gardens, labeled from 1 to n, and an array paths where paths[i] = [xi, yi] describes a bidirectional path between garden xi to garden yi. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

All gardens have at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)th garden. The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation:
Gardens 1 and 2 have different types.
Gardens 2 and 3 have different types.
Gardens 3 and 1 have different types.
Hence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
``` 
```
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4
0 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10^4
paths[i].length == 2
1 <= xi, yi <= n
xi != yi
Every garden has at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.
```

```c++
vector<int> gardenNoAdj(int N, vector<vector<int>>& paths) {
    // Build the Adjacent Graph
    vector<vector<int> > graph(N);
    for (const auto& path : paths) {
        graph[path[0] - 1].push_back(path[1] - 1);
        graph[path[1] - 1].push_back(path[0] - 1);
    }
    
    // Apply greedy algorithm to color each node in the graph
    // since there is at most 3 paths to each guarden, therefore
    // guaranteed that we can find a color for each garden.
    vector<int> res(N, -1);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        bool used[5] = {};
        for (const auto& neighbor : graph[i]) {
            if (res[neighbor] != -1) { // colored
                used[res[neighbor]] = true;
            }
        }
        
        for (int flower = 1; flower < 5; flower++) {
            if (!used[flower]) {
                res[i] = flower; // color garden i with this flower.
            }
        }
    }
    
    return res;
}
