## Score of Parentheses

Given a balanced parentheses string S, compute the score of the string based on the following rule:
```
() has score 1
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
```

#### Example 1:
```
Input: "()"
Output: 1
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: "(())"
Output: 2
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: "()()"
Output: 2
```
#### Example 4:
```
Input: "(()(()))"
Output: 6
``` 
```
Note:

S is a balanced parentheses string, containing only ( and ).
2 <= S.length <= 50
```

```c++
int scoreOfParentheses(string S) {
    stack<int> st;
    int curr = 0;
    for(char c: S) {
        if(c == '(') {
            st.push(curr);
            curr = 0;
        } else {
            curr += st.top() + max(curr, 1);
            st.pop();
        }
    }
    return curr;
}
```
#### Detailed:
```
When travel through S, only meets ')', we need to calculate the score of this pair of parenthese. If we know the score of inner parentheses, such as 3, we can double it and pass to the outer parenthese. But the question is how do we know the score of inner parentheses? Using stack.

explain with "( ( ) ( ( ) ) )"

stack: 0->
string_traveled :""
When start only 0 in stack, this int will store the total score

stack: 0->0->0->
string_traveled:"( ("
Meet two '(', push two zeros to the stack

stack: 0->1->
string_traveled: "( ( )"
First time meets ')', it balance the last '(', so pop the stack. But 0 indicates no inner parentheses exists, so just pass 1 to parent parenthese.

stack: 0->1->0->0->
string_traveled: "( ( ) ( ("
Keep pushing zeros

stack 0->1->1->
string_traveled: "( ( ) ( ( )"
Balance one '(', and still no inner parenthese, so pass 1 to parent

stack 0->3->
string_traveled: "( ( ) ( ( ) )"
Balance another '(', but the inner is not zero, so double it and add to parent's score

stack 6->
string_traveled: "( ( ) ( ( ) ) )"
Same as last step, double the inner score and add to parent's
```
```c++
int scoreOfParentheses(string S)
{
    stack<int> m_stack;
    m_stack.push(0); // to keep the total score
    for(char c:S){
        if(c=='(')
            m_stack.push(0); //When meets '(', just push a zero to stack
        else{
            int tmp=m_stack.top(); //  balance the last '(', it stored the score of inner parentheses
            m_stack.pop();
            int val=0;
            if(tmp>0) // not zero means inner parentheses exists and double it
                val=tmp*2;
            else // zero means no inner parentheses, just using 1
                val=1;
            m_stack.top()+=val; // pass the score of this level to parent parenthese
        }   
    }
    return m_stack.top();
}
```
