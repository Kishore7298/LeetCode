## Subarray Sums Divisible by K

Given an array A of integers, return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays that have a sum divisible by K.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: A = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], K = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by K = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]
``` 
```
Note:

1 <= A.length <= 30000
-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
2 <= K <= 10000
```

```c++
 /*
        If a subarray is divisible by K, it has to be a multiple of K

        a-b=n*k, a = running total, b = any previous subarray sum, same as original prefix sum problems.

        We want to solve for b, so using basic algebra, b=a-n*k

        We don't know what n is, so we can get rid of n by modding every element by k
        (b%k) = (a%k) - (n*k)%k

        since n*k is a multiple of k and k goes into it evenly, the result of the (n *k)%k will be 0

        therefore
        b%k = a%k

        is the same as the formula we defined earlier, a-b=n*k

        where b = running total, a = any previous subarray sum

        So we just have to see if running total mod k is equal to any previous running total mod k
